# 3d Printing Models
I printed everything in PETG except the feet in TPU


# michaelkubina_SpotMicroESP32
This is the primary source of parts. I customized some of these and found some customized ones.


# Outer_Shoulder_round_servohorn
The hip servohorn broke several times, so I updated the model to accept a round, metal servohorn.


# Chassis_Side_longer
Lengthened the body 25mm to accomodate a Jetson Nano and a larger buck converter.

## Summary
This is a remix of Michael Kubina's SpotMicroESP32. It adds a reinforced shoulder joint cover as well as a shorter rear cover and back plate.

For the original SpotMicro the limbs connect to the shoulders only via the servo shaft, which in my experience made for a flimsy/wobbly joint. Reinforcing the joint with an extended shoulder attached to ball bearings on the outer limb improves this considerably.

My shoulder cover design was inspired by the Parametric Shoulder Joint for SpotMicroESP32 from projunk. Notable features are:

Uses 625ZZ ball bearings (as for the original).
The Shoulder Cover attaches to the extended Servo Cap using 3x20 mm screws and M3 nuts (as used by original build).
Hidden screw and nut holes on shoulder cover for a smooth look.
Prints support free.
The new medium rear cover is a shortened version of the long rear cover of the original build. The 3x8mm screws attaching the back plate are now rear facing. The back plate has cut-out inserts for a SSD1306 OLED screen and two GX16 connectors.

The spot shown in the photos has an aluminium top cover with mounting rails. This was made by Thomas Van Der Sterren.
